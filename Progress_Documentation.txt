Notebooks/1_load_projects.ipynb:
    This gets all the projects from the project page and stores them as .parquet files.

Data_Raw/project_tables/ogb_{NUMBER}_{NUMBER}.parquet:
    I scraped all the data from the project search tables and put it into this folder as parquet files. Numbers denote web page numbers.

Notebooks/2_get_project_locations.ipynb:
    This takes all the projects from the parquets, then I get the coordinate locations for each.
    I used an API to get the coordinates for each location. The result is og_geocoded.csv.

Data_Raw/project_tables/og_geocoded.csv:
    This contains the coordinate locations for each project. It is the aggregate of all parquet tables.

These are the records of each unique project from CFA and Georgetown

Notebooks/4_load_meetings.ipynb:
    For the first part of the notebook, I accessed projects that involved a different number of steps,
    then created the Step_Review.pdf to see what the flow was like for each project.

Research/Step_Review.pdf: 
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItQlKFlPT6ztWXrrKrtkvMJlbbIOZEYpuFw-YDsxMSo/edit?usp=sharing
    I grouped all the OGB projects by the number of steps involved, randomly selected one from each number of steps, then reviewed what happened in each of those steps.

This is an example flow for each project, based on the number of times the project was discussed at a CFA/OGB meeting.

Research/Meeting_Page_Sources.pdf: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bw3N5y1cB6Br1CGdc5UHqapjocn9zBdg01My4RIKtUc/edit?usp=sharing
    I put images of the websites the driver went to and webscraped, specifically the OGB/CFA Meeting main pages, then the minutes.
    I did not inlcude the pages for Consent, Denial, Other, or for Old Georgetown Board Appendix.

Notebooks/7_EDA_meeting_appendix_results.ipynb:
    Started exploring consents, denials, and others for each of the OGB projects. 
    BIG ISSUE: it looks like the denials are around 5% of the cases, and of that, most are for 
    insufficient materials, unknown, or inactive applications, topics that are administrative, rather than
    design focused. ABOUT 1% OF THE TOTAL OGB PROJECTS ARE DENIED FOR INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.


    PIVOTING THE PROJECT!
    NEW FOCUS: LOOKING AT THE ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER OF THE PROPERTIES IN THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.
    USING MULTIMODAL LLMS TO CLASSIFY ARCHITECTURE.
    NEXT PART OF THE PROJECT CAN COME BACK TO LINKING THE RESULTS OF THAT TO THE RENOVATIONS THAT ARE DONE
    ON THESE PROPERTIES!
